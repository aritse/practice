TERMS:
Singly linked list - node has a pointer to next node
Doubly linked list - node has pointers to both next and previous nodes
Runner technique - fast pointer moves ahead by a fixed amount or multiples of the slow pointer

CONSIDERATIONS:
Linked list doesn't provide a constant time access to a particular node.
Benefit of a linked list is you can add and remove items from the beginning of
the linked list in constant time.
Be careful when updating the head pointer because it could be referenced elsewhere.
Check null pointer
Update head and tail pointers appropriately
Deallocate deleted node if there is no automatic memory management
Recursive approach may be easier to implement.

QUESTIONS:
Is the linked list singly or doubly?
