TERMS:
Graph - tree is an instance of a graph, but not all graphs are a tree because a graph can have cycles.
Edge - connection between two nodes
Directed - one way
Undirected - two way
Vertex - node
Connected graph - path found between every pair of vertices
Isolated graph - not connected graph
Adjacency list - every vertex stores a list of adjacent vertices. In undirected graph, an edge is stored twice.
    Can use array, hash table, linked list can be used to reprsent an adjacency list.
Adjacency matrix - NxN matrix where N is the number of nodes. Value 1 reprsents that there is an edge between 2 nodes.
    In undirected graph, the matrix is symmetric (overlap if folded diagnally).
DFS - start at a node and explore each branch completely before moving on to the next branch. Simpler than BFS. Must 
    mark a node as Visited to avoid infinite loop. Recursive.
BFS - start at a node and explore each neighbor before moving on to any of their children. Used to find shortest path.
    Not recursive. Use queue and loop.
Bidirectional search - used to find the shortest path. Run two BFS on source and destination until the searches collide.
    Faster than a single BFS by a factor of k^(d/2).
