TERMS:
add(item) - adds an item to the end of the queue
remove() - removes an item from the beginning of the queue
isEmpty() - returns true if the queue is isEmpty

CONSIDERATIONS:
A queue can be implemented with a linked list also.
Make sure update the first and last nodes in a queue.
A stack is used to implement breadth first search. In BFS, we used a queue to stock a list of nodes that we need
    to process. Each time we process a node, we add its adjacent nodes to the back fo the queue. This allows us to 
    process nodes in the order in which they are viewed.
